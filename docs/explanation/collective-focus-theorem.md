## Abstract

Two convergence results for [[collective focus]] on [[authenticated graphs]].

Part I (Special Case): token-weighted [[random walk]] on a strongly connected [[cybergraph]] converges to a unique stationary distribution $\phi^*$ — the system's [[collective focus]]. This is the [[diffusion]] primitive alone.

Part II (General Case): the composite [[tri-kernel]] operator $\mathcal{R} = \lambda_d D + \lambda_s S + \lambda_h H_\tau$ is a contraction. Its fixed point $\phi^*$ minimizes a [[free energy]] functional and is computable locally. When $\lambda_s = \lambda_h = 0$, Part II reduces to Part I.

Together these establish that [[collective focus]] converges under the full [[tri-kernel]] — the mathematical foundation for [[egregore]].

This is the standalone paper. The normative, in-spec formulation of the same result is [[tri-kernel]] §3; the five equivalent readings of $\phi^*$ are [[tri-kernel]] §2.4.

## Part I: Special Case — Diffusion Convergence

### Axiom 1: Consensus Equilibrium

In a strongly connected, weighted [[cybergraph]], a unique stationary distribution $\phi^* = [\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_n]$ exists for the [[random walk]] defined by:

$$p_{ij} = \frac{w_{ij} \cdot t_j}{\sum_k w_{ik} \cdot t_k}$$

where $p_{ij}$ is the transition probability from [[particle]] $i$ to $j$, $w_{ij}$ is the edge weight, and $t_j$ is the [[token]] value at $j$.

The stationary distribution satisfies:

$$\phi^*_j = \sum_i \phi^*_i \cdot p_{ij} \quad \forall\, j \in V$$

This equilibrium represents the emergent [[collective focus]]: $\phi^*_j$ is the long-term significance of [[particle]] $j$ as determined by graph structure and [[token]] dynamics.

### Axiom 2: Dynamic Adaptation

The [[cybergraph]] adapts to changes in structure ($w_{ij}$) or [[token]] distribution ($t_j$) while maintaining stability:

$$\phi^*_j(t+1) = \phi^*_j(t) + \alpha \cdot \Delta_j(t)$$

where $\alpha$ is the adaptation rate and $\Delta_j(t)$ is the change in node significance.

### Axiom 3: Probabilistic Influence

The influence of each [[neuron]] on [[collective focus]] is proportional to [[token]] value and connectivity:

$$\text{Influence}(j) = \frac{\sum_{i \in V} w_{ij} \cdot t_j}{\sum_{i,k \in V} w_{ik} \cdot t_k}$$

### Corollaries

Corollary 1 (Stability): Small perturbations in $w_{ij}$ or $t_j$ do not destabilize the equilibrium: $\lim_{t \to \infty} \phi^*_j(t) = \phi^*_j + \varepsilon, \quad |\varepsilon| \ll \phi^*_j$

Corollary 2 (Decentralized Computation): [[focus]] $\phi^*_j$ for each node can be computed locally by summing contributions from incoming edges.

Corollary 3 (Emergent Modularity): Clusters of strongly connected [[particles]] naturally emerge, forming modules: $C_i = \{ j \in V \mid \phi^*_j > \tau \}$ where $\tau$ is a significance threshold.

### Statement

Consider a [[cybergraph]] $G = (V, E, W)$ with $|V| = n$ [[particles]]. Each [[cyberlink]] $(i, j) \in E$ has weight $w_{ij} \geq 0$. Each [[particle]] $j$ has [[token]] value $t_j > 0$. Define transition probabilities:

$$p_{ij} = \frac{w_{ij} \cdot t_j}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}(i)} w_{ik} \cdot t_k}$$

Assumptions: $G$ is strongly connected (directed path between any pair) and aperiodic (gcd of all directed cycle lengths is 1).

Claim: there exists a unique stationary distribution $\phi^*$ satisfying $\phi^* P = \phi^*$ with $\sum_i \phi^*_i = 1$.

### Proof

Step 1 (Markov Chain): The matrix $P = [p_{ij}]$ is stochastic. Non-negativity: $p_{ij} \geq 0$ since $w_{ij} \geq 0$ and $t_j > 0$.

Step 2 (Irreducibility): For any pair $(u, v)$, a path from $u$ to $v$ exists with positive probability. The chain is irreducible.

Step 3 (Uniqueness): Since $P$ is irreducible and aperiodic, the chain is ergodic. By the [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]], a unique stationary distribution $\phi^*$ exists satisfying $\phi^* P = \phi^*$, $\sum_i \phi^*_i = 1$.

Step 4 (Convergence): By the ergodic theorem, for any initial distribution $\mu^{(0)}$:

$$\phi^* = \lim_{t \to \infty} \mu^{(0)} \cdot P^t$$

Step 5 (Interpretation): The stationary distribution $\phi^*$ is a stable [[consensus]] of observation probabilities. Each $\phi^*_j$ reflects both the [[particle]]'s structural position and the [[neuron]] [[token]] influence. This is the simplest Schelling point everyone can universally agree on.

## Part II: General Case — Composite Contraction

Part I proves convergence for [[diffusion]] alone. The [[tri-kernel]] combines three operators. We prove the composite converges as well.

### The Composite Operator

The [[tri-kernel]] blends [[diffusion]], [[springs]], and [[heat]] into a single update (see [[tri-kernel]] for full specification):

$$\phi^{(t+1)} = \text{norm}\big[\lambda_d \cdot D(\phi^t) + \lambda_s \cdot S(\phi^t) + \lambda_h \cdot H_\tau(\phi^t)\big]$$

where $\lambda_d + \lambda_s + \lambda_h = 1$, $D$ is the [[diffusion]] step, $S$ is the [[springs]] equilibrium map, $H_\tau$ is the [[heat]] map, and $\text{norm}(\cdot)$ projects to the simplex. The operators are applied to the same current $\phi$ each step and blended — this single coupled iteration, not three independent solves, is what the contraction below governs.

### Contraction Lemmas

Lemma 1 (Diffusion Contracts): Under ergodicity of $P$ with teleport parameter $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the diffusion map $D$ satisfies $\|D\phi - D\psi\|_1 \leq \alpha \|\phi - \psi\|_1$. This follows from Part I: the teleport ensures geometric mixing with rate $\alpha$.

Lemma 2 (Springs Contract): Under screening parameter $\mu > 0$, the screened [[Laplacian]] solve $S: \phi \mapsto (L + \mu I)^{-1}(\mu x_0)$ satisfies $\|S\phi - S\psi\|_2 \leq \frac{\|L\|}{\|L\| + \mu} \|\phi - \psi\|_2$. The Green's function $(L + \mu I)^{-1}$ decays exponentially with distance — screening ensures locality and contraction.

Lemma 3 (Heat Contracts): For bounded temperature $\tau > 0$, the heat kernel $H_\tau = \exp(-\tau L)$ satisfies $\|H_\tau \phi - H_\tau \psi\|_2 \leq e^{-\tau \lambda_2} \|\phi - \psi\|_2$ where $\lambda_2$ is the Fiedler eigenvalue. Positivity-preserving and semigroup properties ensure well-defined contraction.

### Theorem (Composite Contraction)

Under ergodicity of $P$, screening $\mu > 0$, and bounded $\tau$, the composite operator $\mathcal{R}$ is a contraction:

$$\|\mathcal{R}\phi - \mathcal{R}\psi\| \leq \kappa \|\phi - \psi\|, \quad \kappa = \lambda_d \alpha + \lambda_s \frac{\|L\|}{\|L\|+\mu} + \lambda_h e^{-\tau\lambda_2} < 1$$

Since each component contracts and $\mathcal{R}$ is a convex combination, $\kappa$ is a convex combination of individual contraction coefficients — each less than 1, hence $\kappa < 1$. By Banach fixed-point theorem, $\phi^t \to \phi^*$ at linear rate.

### Free Energy Minimization

The fixed point $\phi^*$ minimizes:

$$\mathcal{F}(\phi) = \lambda_s\left[\frac{1}{2}\phi^\top L\phi + \frac{\mu}{2}\|\phi-x_0\|^2\right] + \lambda_h\left[\frac{1}{2}\|\phi-H_\tau\phi\|^2\right] + \lambda_d \cdot D_{KL}(\phi \| D\phi)$$

elastic structure + deviation from heat-smoothed context + alignment with diffusion image. this is variational [[free energy]] minimization in the sense of Friston.

### Locality Radius

For edit batch $e_\Delta$, there exists $h = O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ such that recomputing on the $h$-hop neighborhood $N_h$ achieves global error $\leq \varepsilon$. This follows from: geometric decay ([[diffusion]], teleport), exponential decay ([[springs]], screening), Gaussian tail ([[heat]], kernel bandwidth).

### Reduction

When $\lambda_s = \lambda_h = 0$: $\mathcal{R} = D$, $\kappa = \alpha$, $\mathcal{F}$ reduces to $D_{KL}(\phi \| D\phi)$, and the fixed point is the stationary distribution $\phi^*$ from Part I. The general case subsumes the special case.

## Complexity

Memory and computation scale linearly with [[cybergraph]] size:

| Storage Type | Bytes per [[particle]] | Bytes per [[cyberlink]] |
|---|---|---|
| volatile | 56 | 24 |
| persistent | 72 | 128 |

per-iteration complexity: $O(V + E)$

total work to reach precision $\varepsilon$:

$$O\left(\frac{(E + V) \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)}{\lambda}\right)$$

where $\lambda$ is the [[spectral gap]] governing [[convergence]] rate. see [[emergence]] for scaling estimates across [[intelligence]] phases

## Conclusion

Two results, one framework. Part I establishes that token-weighted [[random walk]] converges to a unique [[collective focus]] — the Schelling point of the [[cybergraph]]. Part II extends this to the full [[tri-kernel]], proving the composite operator contracts and its fixed point minimizes [[free energy]]. Together they provide the mathematical foundation for [[egregore]]: a convergent, local, verifiable computation of collective [[intelligence]].

the fixed point φ* is a mathematical consequence of three properties: ergodicity ([[diffusion]]), screening ([[springs]]), bounded temperature ([[heat]]). convergence follows from [[Banach]] fixed-point theorem — it is proven, not postulated. no selection principle is needed to pick the "right" state: the contraction mapping leaves exactly one. see [[consistency]] for why this matters and [[locality]] for why it scales.

see [[tri-kernel architecture]] for why these three operators. see [[tri-kernel]] for the formal specification. see [[bostrom]] for empirical validation
